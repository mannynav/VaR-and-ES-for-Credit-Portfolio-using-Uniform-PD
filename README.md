## README

The goal of this project was to compute the Value-at-Risk and Expected Shortfall of a credit portfolio using the Conditional Monte Carlo estimate, which is known to always reduce the variance of the the traditional Monte Carlo estimate. This is one of many examples in my dissertaion "Applications using Conditional Monte Carlo for Sums". Specifications for the project will be given below.
